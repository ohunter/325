This lab in general was fairly easy especially since it took me about 2 hours to complete the whole thing. The only thing I don't understand why happens is that big.c reports that it misread a single sector for some reason. Other than that the lab really only required you to have a good understanding of how the file and directory structure is originally implemented. This in itself is not something that is difficult, so all in all it was a fun lab.
